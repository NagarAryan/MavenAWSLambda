Creating a README file for your GitHub repository that focuses on creating a Lambda function using Apache Maven and Java is a great idea. Here's a template you can use as a starting point:

# AWS Lambda Function with Apache Maven and Java

This repository contains the source code and instructions for creating an AWS Lambda function using Apache Maven and Java. 

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed and set up:

- [Amazon Web Services (AWS) account](https://aws.amazon.com/)
- [AWS CLI](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/)
- [Java Development Kit (JDK)](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html)
- [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi)

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/your-lambda-repo.git
   ```

2. **Build the Project**

   Navigate to the project directory and build it using Apache Maven:

   ```bash
   cd your-lambda-repo
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Create an AWS Lambda Function**

   Use the AWS CLI to create your Lambda function. Replace `your-function-name`, `your-handler-class`, and `your-artifact.jar` with appropriate values.

   ```bash
   aws lambda create-function --function-name your-function-name --runtime java11 --role your-iam-role-arn --handler your-handler-class::handleRequest --zip-file fileb://target/your-artifact.jar
   ```

4. **Invoke Your Lambda Function**

   To test your Lambda function, you can invoke it using the AWS CLI:

   ```bash
   aws lambda invoke --function-name your-function-name --payload '{"key1": "value1", "key2": "value2"}' output.json
   ```

5. **Cleanup**

   Don't forget to delete your Lambda function when you're done:

   ```bash
   aws lambda delete-function --function-name your-function-name
   ```

## Configuration

You can configure your Lambda function by editing the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file.

## Deployment

To deploy your Lambda function, you can use the AWS Lambda console, the AWS CLI, or integrate this repository with a CI/CD pipeline.
